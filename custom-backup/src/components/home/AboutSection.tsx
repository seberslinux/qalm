              At SENSORY, we understand the unique challenges faced by
              individuals with sensory sensitivities. Our mission is to create
              clothing that feels as good as it looks, with an unwavering
              commitment to comfort, quality, and inclusivity.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Every piece in our collection is thoughtfully designed with
              seamless construction, tag-free labels, ultra-soft fabrics, and
              adjustable features to accommodate various sensory needs. We
              believe that everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their own
              skinâ€”and in their clothes.
